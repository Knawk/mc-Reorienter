# Reorienter

NOTE: this plugin is public for archival purposes only; it is no longer maintained.

**Reorienter** is a Spigot plugin for Minecraft 1.17 that allows players to easily reorient blocks.
Players can craft the *Reorienter* item from amethyst shards, redstone dust, and a compass.
Left-clicking a block with the *Reorienter* item sets the block's orientation based on the clicked block face.
Right-clicking cycles between the block's vertical or horizontal orientations, depending on whether a vertical or horizontal block face was clicked.
